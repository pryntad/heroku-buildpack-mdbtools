.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
\fBmdb-header\fP is deprecated. Soon, it will no longer be distributed.
.PP
It is the feeling of developers that it is not used, as C code generation
is now usually replaced by more generic approaches, including libmdb calls
and odbc.
.PP
However, should you find this tool useful, drop us a line at
https://github.com/mdbtools/mdbtools/issues/197
and we'll consider maintaining it.
