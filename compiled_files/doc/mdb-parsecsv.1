.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmdb-parsecsv\fP is a utility program distributed with MDB Tools.
.PP
\fBmdb-parsecsv\fP takes a CSV \fIfile\fP representing a database table, and converts
it into a C array.
.SH NOTES
If the first argument does not exist as a \fIfile\fP, \fBmdb-parsecsv\fP will look for
the same filename with '.txt' appended.
.PP
The \fIfile\fP extension is stripped, and the output written to the base name
plus a '.c' extension.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B
MDB_JET3_CHARSET
Defines the charset of the input JET3 (access 97) \fIfile\fP. Default is CP1252. See \fBiconv\fP(1).
.TP
.B
MDBICONV
Defines the output charset to use for the SQL \fIfile\fP. Default is UTF-8. mdbtools must have been compiled with iconv.

.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
\fBmdb-parsecsv\fP is deprecated. Soon, it will no longer be distributed.
.PP
It is the feeling of developers that it is not used, as C code generation
is now usually replaced by more generic approaches, including libmdb calls
and odbc.
.PP
However, should you find this tool useful, drop us a line at
https://github.com/mdbtools/mdbtools/issues/197
and we'll consider maintaining it.
